    Maggie Hassan has been a Democrat for her entire career, having held office as the New Hampshire state Senate Democratic majority leader. In
2012, she won the New Hampshire gubernatorial election by a small margin – less than 800 votes. From 2013 to 2017, she held the position of the governor of New Hampshire. In 2016, Hassan was elected into the US Senate, making her one of the only two women in American history to be elected both governor and US Senator.

    Hassan follows the platform of climate change and protecting reproductive rights. 
Bolduc is pro-life and wants to decrease federal government control over states. He also calls for better fiscal responsibility, economy, and security. During the primaries, Republican candidate Chuck Morse lost to Bolduc by less than 2% of the vote, while Hassan won in the Democratic primary by more than 88% of the vote. Given this, it appears that Republican voters in NH are divided and may contribute to a win for Hassan. 

Bolduc originally supported the rhetoric that the 2020 election was stolen, but changed his stance after winning the primaries. He has focused largely on Hassan’s fiscal policies, and argues that controversial topics like abortion should not take precedent over dealing with the economy. During her time as Senator over the past few years, Hassan’s work has been focused on preventing big pharma from rising drug prices and surprise billing practices, as well as negotiating a bipartisan infrastructure law.
