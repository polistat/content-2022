  <WideBox>
    Many voters care about inflation, housing, and abortion. Bennet thinks the Inflation Reduction Act will help ease inflation, but O’Dea disagrees. Bennet supports abortion rights and has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood, while O’Dea is against some protections, including a recent Colorado law that protects the right to abortion. O’Dea’s campaign is also focused on reducing crime, while Bennet’s campaign hasn’t said much about the issue. Finally, O’Dea has said that he wouldn’t always vote with Republicans if he was elected to the Senate.
