## About Hawaii
Hawaii is a group of volcanic islands in the central Pacific Ocean, becoming the 50th U.S. state in 1959. Hawaii has a strong economy, with diversified agriculture and manufacturing, and also serves as an important location for research and development in oceanography, geophysics, astronomy, and biomedicine. Of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii is the 8th smallest in land area and 11th least populous, but ranks 13th in population density and is one of the country's most diverse states, serving as a unique melting pot of North American and East Asian cultures. Because of its large native population, Hawaii has voted strongly Democratic in all elections since 1960, except for two.

    - **Gun Control**: Schatz supports banning military-style weapons and universal background checks. McDermott believes nothing needs to be done.
- **Climate**: Schatz believes investment in clean energy and cutting carbon pollution will help mitigate a climate crisis. McDermott uses clean energy, but does not think there will be a crisis in the future regarding climate change.
- **Red Hill**: Red Hill is a military fuel storage facility. In 2021, two fuel leaks from the site contaminated the local water supply, affecting nearly 100,000 Hawaiians. On this issue, both candidates agree that the facility needs to be decommissioned.
