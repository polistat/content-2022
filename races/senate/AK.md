## About Alaska
Alaska is a state in the North Western region of the United States. It has been a state for about 63 years now, has a population of around 736,000, and the median income is $77.8k. Around half of the population lives in the Anchorage metropolitan area, which has almost ten times the population of the next largest Alaskan city, Fairbanks. It has the highest proportional indigenous population, at around 15%, with the rest being almost entirely White. While per capita income in Alaska is one of the highest in the country, it has an equally high cost of living due to its remote nature. Its economy depends heavily on natural resource extraction, particularly oil, coal, silver, and zinc. Almost 85% of the state budget is supplied by oil revenue. It also has large tourism, logging, and fishing sectors, as well as being greatly supported by the US military bases in the region. Alaska has been republican leaning since the 1970's.

    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
    Major issues on which Tshibaka and Murkowski diverge are cooperation with Democrats, abortion access, education, and support for former president Trump. On her campaign website Tshibaka highlights her support for expanding oil access, deregulating the economy, supporting former president Trump, privatizing healthcare, and promoting election security as key issues that differentiate her from Murkowski. During public events she has repeatedly criticized Murkowski for voting to impeach former president Trump, working with president Joe Biden, being a DC insider, and being the second generation of Murkowski to hold the seat. Murkowski has a wider and more detailed range of policy issues and strategies, and has highlighted Tshibaka’s comparative absence and reliance on Trump’s endorsement to paint her as lacking the experience or plan necessary to be an effective senator.
