    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
    Murray strongly advocates for working families, abortion rights, and is strongly against former President Donald Trump. During the pandemic, Murray’s work has largely focused on lowering everyday costs for middle class families in Washington and pushing for major corporations to “pay their fair share.” As a five-term incumbent, Murray is considered a reliable Democrat vote in Congress. 

Smiley now uses a slogan of being the “New Mom in Town” -- a reference to Murray’s original campaign slogan in 1992 as the “Mom in Tennis Shoes.” Given that Washington has consistently been a blue state for decades, Smiley has taken on a more moderate-Republican position. She does not support abortion but does not want a federal ban on it. She is not officially backed by Trump, but she has met with Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell before. While she states that Biden did win the 2020 presidential elections, she has voiced concerns over the integrity of the election and has called for the courts to “give all evidence of voter fraud a fair hearing.” As the discourse over abortion has risen over the past few months, Smiley’s position is that she is pro-life but does not support a federal abortion ban.
