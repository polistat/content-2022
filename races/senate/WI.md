    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
    Inflation is the number one concern among voters. Johnson believes the problem is high government spending. Lt. Gov. Barnes said some targeted tax changes are needed. Abortion is also a main issue being discussed by voters. Barnes is calling for a new federal law allowing access to abortion; he wants to end the filibuster in the Senate. Johnson opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is at risk. He said individual states should use referendums to decide if abortion should be allowed. Johnson and Barnes are also political polar opposites with very different bases of support.
