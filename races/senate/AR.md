  <WideBox>
    Boozman's campaign themes span securing the border, winning the War on Terror by confronting "Radical Islam", protecting our Second Amendment rights, and overhauling Arkansas' tax code. His stance on these issues has earned him ex-President Donald Trump's "complete and total endorsement" as well as endorsement from Republic political spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Arkansas' current Republic senator Tom Cotton.  Notable controversies from his previous terms include his "not guilty" vote in Donald Trump's impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors, his signature on a letter to Iran warning against signing a nuclear deal with the Obama Administration, and claiming that Planned Parenthood has played a role in "harvesting organs from unborn babies" during the Planned Parenthood controversy in 2016. He has repeatedly voted against the renewal of the Violence Against Woman Act and to restrict women's abortion rights whenever possible.
    James claims that she will end current Arkansas Republic Senator and Boozmanï¿½s close friend Tim Cotton's "dark money", asserting that his money has been used to silence candidates in previous elections. If elected, she hopes to serve on the joint economic committee, the small business & entrepreneurship committee, the banking, housing, & urban affairs committee, and the agriculture, nutrition, & forestry committee in the Senate. She plans to expand access to voting rights for all groups, criminal justic reform, affordable health care, advocate for a living wage, move our nation forward on the climate crisis, and invest in Arkansas's public education system. James would like to restore hope and trust in the government.
