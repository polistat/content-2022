    It is important to note that, due to how close the race is, the roughly 4% of voters opting for Chase Oliver (L) will have a significant swing in the outcome of the race, as one candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to prevent a run-off election. Important issues in Georgia include law enforcement reform, COVID-19 regulations, and labor rights.
