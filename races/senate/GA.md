## About Georgia
The 6th largest state by population, Georgia has historically voted republican but in recent times Georgia has become a swing state. Over the last twenty years, Georgia's white population has decreased from 71% to 60%. Nearly six in every ten of Georgia's population resides in its largest city, Atlanta, and its surrounding metropolitan area, which is 50% black. Georgia is known for its peach cobbler and for being the first state to lower the legal voting age from 21 to 18 under the slogan "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote" following the onset of World War II.

    It is important to note that, due to how close the race is, the roughly 4% of voters opting for Chase Oliver (L) will have a significant swing in the outcome of the race, as one candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to prevent a run-off election. Important issues in Georgia include law enforcement reform, COVID-19 regulations, and labor rights.
