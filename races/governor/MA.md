    #### Primaries

    Healey was virtually unopposed in the Democratic primaries, as her opponent unofficially withdrew but remained on the ballot. She won with 85% of the vote.

    The Republican primaries were fairly close, with Diehl winning against his opponent Chris Doughty 55.5% to 44.5%. This close result could be explained by the fact that Diehl’s stances are more extreme than those of Doughty and of previous Republican candidates: Massachusetts generally prefers to nominate moderate Republican candidates to appeal to the overall liberal-leaning population.

    Big issues for this election include the increasing unaffordability of living in Massachusetts, the housing crisis, small business, climate change and energy production, higher quality education, and healthcare/public infrastructure. Diehl’s campaign also has a focus on safety, aiming to reduce crime rates and increase school safety, and on defending individual freedom, being in favor of the 2nd Amendment and against certain vaccine mandates. Healey’s campaign also focuses on treatment of immigrants, criminal justice reform, and reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights.
