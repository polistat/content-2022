    Dan McKee is the incumbent. He was sworn in when the previous governor resigned to serve as the US secretary of commerce. Seems to be a pretty general democrat. Not a maverick, follows typical democratic ideals. Main ideologies involve education initiatives and providing increased economic opportunities.

    Ashley Kalus seems to be a pretty far right conservative candidate, She focuses much on educational policy. Although she hasn’t spoken directly out against it, she seems to be against critical race theory and its inclusion in school curriculums.

    There isn’t much controversy on Kalus’ side. For McKee, he only assumed the position a year ago when the previous incumbent resigned. Not sure if this would qualify as controversial, but Dan McKee only barely made it out of the primaries, while Kalus’ was practically unmatched.
