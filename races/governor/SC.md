    Henry McMaster is a Trump-endorsed Republican, as McMaster was one of the first elected officials to endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and Trump returned the favor by endorsing McMaster's current campaign early on in March 2021. McMaster has been in South Carolina politics since 1981, when President Reagan nominated him to be the U.S. Attorney for South Carolina. Since then, he's served as Attorney General of South Carolina, Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina, and a full term as Governor of South Carolina, in addition to serving the final two years of Nikki Haley's SC governor term after she was appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the UN under the Trump administration.

    #### Issues & controversies

    Tally Casey, the first female fighter pilot in South Carolina and Democrat Joe Cunningham's running mate, is championing the issue of abortion, a major campaign point for the democratic ballot. Although the most recent conservative push for tightening abortion restrictions failed in the SC state congress, the state has historically been at the forefront of efforts to challenge Roe v. Wade before it was overturned. Another major issue is politician ageâ€”Cunningham frequently highlights the 35 year age difference between himself and incumbent Republican Henry McMaster, suggesting that McMaster is too old to be governing and should have gotten more done throughout the rest of his career. South Carolina's crumbling infrastructure and gas tax are also major issues for both candidates. McMaster has refused to suspend the state's gradually rising gas tax in the name of using the revenue to fund road repairs, while Cunningham advocates for a temporary suspension while gas prices are high overall. Cunningham also claims that the tax suspension wouldn't hurt infrastructure repairs due to the money South Carolina will receive from the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure restoration bill passed by the federal government.
