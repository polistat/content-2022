  <WideBox>
    One of the key issues of the race is the Safe-T Act, a criminal justice reform law which will eliminate cash bail. Pritzker champions the law while Bailey is calling for its repeal. Another is abortion access: after Roe v. Wade was overturned, Pritzker is working to expand access while Bailey is a firm pro-lifer.
