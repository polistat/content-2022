## About Vermont
Vermont is the second least-populous state in the US, located in the very northeastern corner with a border with Canada. Despite an extremely rural population, the state is known to vote Democrat for Senators and Governors, with the notable exception of the current Governor being a Republican. Unlike all other states, Vermont’s governors serve for only 2 years in a term.
