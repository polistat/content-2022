    Abortion rights play a key role in the debates between the political parties. DeJear has more liberal views as she discusses developing Iowa to be more inclusive for POC and LGBTQ+ people. DeJear is an activist and small business owner and would be Iowa’s first Black statewide officeholder if elected. Other hot-topic issues such as immigration, inflation, and rising gas prices are less contested. Reynolds had already passed legislation regarding gun control, specifically, handgun carry without a constitutional carry permit. Similar advocacy and legislation include advocacy against same-sex marriage and support through vetoes of challenged Trump policies related to immigration, asylum, abortion, birth control, environmental deregulation, gun policy, and LGBTQ+ rights. Reynolds condemned the January 6 raid on the Capitol. In May 2018, Reynolds signed a “fetal heartbeat bill” which created one of the most restrictive abortion bans.
