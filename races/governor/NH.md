    Tom Sherman has previously won the elections for State Senate in District 24 in both 2019 and 2020. His views generally align with the more progressive ideals of the Democratic party. For most issues in the race, both Sherman and Sununu take predictable stances.

    The governor, since 2017, has been the incumbent Republican Chris Sununu. Chris Sununu is not a Trump-endorsed candidate; as a matter of fact, Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, claimed to look for a “challenger” to dethrone Chris Sununu of his position. He doesn’t stray far from the primary principles of the Republican party, although few of his decisions have been controversial; for example, he recently rejected a run for the 2022 Senate in order to pursue a fourth term as governor, a decision not foreseen by those in Washington. Chris Sununu is also relatively popular as he is a more moderate candidate; for example, he supported access to medical marijuana, which is uncommon for a politician of his political affiliation.

    The Republican primaries were not hotly contested, as Chris Sununu won with 79% of the vote (78,274 votes in total). It is worth noting that Sununu in 2020 received the most ever votes for a candidate in New Hampshire’s history, and his support hasn’t shown significant signs of slowing down.

    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
    One of the issues in the race regards health-related issues such as abortion. Tom Sherman has a heavy focus on medical issues (e.g. pricing transparency), as a result of his background as physician and his involvement with the Health and Human Services Committee as a senator. Chris Sununu has claimed to be pro-choice, although he also enacted the first modern day abortion ban. He's been accused of being a "flip-flop" on this issue, which doesn't go down well with supporters.
