    Some of the issues addressed in this race are abortion and gun control. Both Sisolak and Lombardo agree to support abortion and contraceptive access, although Lombardo caveats his support on popular decision. However there is a major divergence on gun control. Sisolak is a moderate democrat in favor of requiring background checks and such, while Lombardo is against almost any form of gun control, including being in favor of ghost guns. Sisolak focuses on climate change, Lombardo focuses on border security. Both say they won’t raise taxes.
