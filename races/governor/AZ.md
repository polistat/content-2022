    #### Issues & controversies

  <WideBox>
    Kari Lake considers abortion to be “the ultimate sin”, while Katie Hobbs is pro-choice and intends to improve access to reproductive healthcare. 

Both Lake and Hobbs intend to protect Arizona’s border from criminal activity and trafficking, and both oppose the actions recently taken by various politicians to send immigrants to places such as Martha’s Vineyard. Hobbs, however, puts an emphasis on preventing humanitarian crises at the border, while Lake takes a more militant approach, referring to the situation as “an invasion”.

Lake has faced controversy for spreading COVID-19 misinformation and supporting an antisemitic Senate candidate. She has been labeled a “conspiracy theorist” by Hobbs, who refused to debate her.
